# Custom Authentication

Occasionally, the API requires an authentication mechanism different from the typical ones. The `custom_auth` type can be used in this case. The custom authentication provides you with the ability to do the following:

- acquire and/or refresh credentials
- Define when credentials should be refreshed
- Store credentials data not provided directly by user (obtained from API requests)

## Example custom authentication

This example connects to [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/api/using-authentication-token.html)

```ruby
connection: {
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'email'
    },
    {
      name: 'password',
      control_type: 'password'
    }
  ],

  authorization: {
    type: 'custom_auth',

    acquire: lambda do |connection|
      {
        authtoken:
          get('https://accounts.zoho.com/apiauthtoken/nb/create').
          params('SCOPE' => 'ZohoCRM/crmapi',
                 'EMAIL_ID' => connection['email'],
                 'PASSWORD' => connection['password'],
                 'DISPLAY_NAME' => 'Workato test adapter').
          response_format_raw[/(?<=AUTHTOKEN=)\h+/]
      }
    end,

    refresh_on: [
      # Three ways to match:
      401, # Integer HTTP response code.
      'Unauthorized', # String that equals the whole body or whole title of the error response.
      /Unauthorized/, # Regex that matches with the body or title of the error response.
      /Invalid Ticket Id/ # The actual "signal" that we need to re-authorize in Zoho.
    ],

    detect_on: [
      # Two ways to match: String (matches whole body of the response), and:
      /^\{"response":\{"error"/, # Regex that matches the body of the response.
    ],

    apply: lambda do |connection|
      params(authtoken: connection['authtoken'])
    end
  }
}
```

## acquire

Context is same as an action's execute block. You can write the require code here to acquire and store relevant credentials data to be used in the `apply` block.
```ruby
acquire: lambda do |connection|
  {
    authtoken:
      get('https://accounts.zoho.com/apiauthtoken/nb/create').
      params('SCOPE' => 'ZohoCRM/crmapi',
             'EMAIL_ID' => connection['email'],
             'PASSWORD' => connection['password'],
             'DISPLAY_NAME' => 'Workato test adapter').
      response_format_raw[/(?<=AUTHTOKEN=)\h+/]
  }
end
```

The output of this block should be a **hash**, which will be merged with the original connection object.

This API request to the Auth token endpoint returns a raw text response with the Auth token like this:
```
AUTHTOKEN=bad18eba1ff45jk7858b8ae88a77fa30
RESULT=TRUE
```

As a result, the connection object is merged with this value after executing the `acquire` block.

Original `connection` object
```json
{
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "password": "pinkfloyd"
}
```
`connection` object after executing `acquire` block
```json
{
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "password": "pinkfloyd",
  "authtoken": "SAMPLE_TOKEN"
}
```

This new connection object will be passed into all actions, triggers, test and pick lists as the `connection` argument.

## apply

Synonym of the `credentials` block: Basically how to apply the credentials to an action/trigger/test request. All requests made in actions, triggers, tests and pick lists will be applied with the credentials defined here.

Here are a list of accepted inputs into the apply block

```ruby
apply: lambda do |connection|
  #adds in URL parameters passed as a hash object i.e. authtoken=[connection['authtoken']]
  params(authtoken: connection['authtoken']) 
  
  #Adds in payload fields (PATCH, POST, PUT only) pass as hash
  payload(
          grant_type: "authorization_code",
          client_id: connection["client_id"],
          client_secret: connection["client_secret"],
          code: auth_code
        ) 
        
  # Adds in headers into every request passed as a hash. 
  # The variable access_token can be retrieved from input prompts defined in the 'fields' schema earlier or a return from the acquire block i.e. Authorization : Bearer [given access token]
  headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection["access_token"]}") 
  
  # Used in conjunction with password function below. 
  # i.e. sends the input as username and password in HTTP authentication
  user(connection["username"])  
  password(connection["username"]) 
end
```

In the ZOHO CRM example above, the `authtoken` that is returned from the `acquire` block is used in the `apply` block to add URL parameters to every subsequent request by the connector.

This needn't be the case for simpler methods of authentication where apply blocks can pull directly from user input fields in the `connection` object.

```ruby
connection: {

  fields: [
    {
      name: "token",
      control_type: "string",
      label: "Bearer token",
      optional: false,
      hint: "Available in 'My Profile' page"
    }
  ],

  authorization: {
    type: 'custom_auth',

    apply: lambda do |connection|
        headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection["token"]}")
    end
  }
}
```

Over here, we send over an user input token in the every request made by the custom connector in the header.

> The "apply" block will not be applied to any requests made in "acquire". So you will have to include the required credentials for a successful API request here.

## refresh_on

This is an optional array of **signals** that is used to identify a need to re-acquire credentials . When an erroneous response is received (400, 401, 500...), the SDK framework checks it against this list of signals. If a match is found, it triggers a re-authorization (execute `acquire`).

This list is optional. If not defined, will default to one attempt at re-acquiring credentials for all errors.

```ruby
refresh_on: [
  401,
  'Unauthorized',
  /Unauthorized/,
  /Invalid Ticket Id/
]
```

The example here shows multiple ways that we can define "signals" to watch.

- `401`: The response status code
- `"Unauthorized"`: The exact string matching the whole body or title of response
- `/Unauthorized/`: Regex matching the body or title of response
- `/Invalid Ticket Id/`: The actual "message" to watch for in the case of the Zoho API

## detect_on

Certain APIs don't signal errors with explicit response status code like a `401`. Instead, they return a `200` (pseudo successful response) with a payload that signals the error.

For such APIs, an error (expired credentials, bad requests etc.) will not be picked up since it is interpreted as a successful request (Status code `200`). A match with the signals defined here will raise an error.

When there is a match here, two things can happen.

Firstly, there can also be a match against `refresh_on` signals. When that happens, a re-authorization is triggered (acquire block is executed) instead of raising an error. In this case, `detect_on` is used to match errors hidden behind responses with status code `200`, then used to identify that a credentials refresh is required.

If a match here does not match any of the signals defined in `refresh_on`, an error will be raised.

```ruby
detect_on: [
  "sample error message",
  /^\{"response":\{"error".+$/
]
```

The example here shows multiple ways that we can define "signals" to watch

- `"sample error message"`: The exact string matching the whole body of response
- `/^\{"response":\{"error".+$/`: Regex matching the body of response

This list is optional. If not defined, pseudo successful response will be treated as a successful request instead of raising exceptions. Note: output values of trigger and action will be affected.
