# Header Authentication

For APIs requiring header authentication, this can be easily accomplished if when the token is supplied by the user directly.

## Example header authentication

```ruby
connection: {

  fields: [
    {
      name: "token",
      control_type: "string",
      label: "Bearer token",
      optional: false,
      hint: "Available in 'My Profile' page"
    }
  ],

  authorization: {
    type: 'custom_auth',

    apply: lambda do |connection|
        headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection["token"]}")
    end
  }
}
```

## apply

Synonym of the `credentials` block: Basically how to apply the credentials to an action/trigger/test request. All requests made in actions, triggers, tests and pick lists will be applied with the credentials defined here. In the example above, the apply block pulls the `token` field directly from user input fields in the `connection` object.

Here are a list of accepted inputs into the apply block

```ruby
apply: lambda do |connection|
  # Adds in URL parameters passed as a hash object
  # i.e. authtoken=[connection['authtoken']]
  params(authtoken: connection['authtoken'])

  #Adds in payload fields (PATCH, POST, PUT only) pass as hash
  payload(grant_type: "authorization_code",
          client_id: connection["client_id"],
          client_secret: connection["client_secret"],
          code: auth_code)

  # Adds in headers into every request passed as a hash.
  # The variable access_token can be retrieved from input prompts defined in the 'fields' schema earlier or a return from the acquire block
  # i.e. Authorization : Bearer [given access token]
  headers("Authorization": "Bearer #{connection["access_token"]}")  

  # Used in conjunction with password function
  # i.e. sends the input as username and password in HTTP authentication
  user(connection["username"])   
  password(connection["username"])
end
```

> The "apply" block will not be applied to any requests made in "acquire". So you will have to include the required credentials for a successful API request here.
