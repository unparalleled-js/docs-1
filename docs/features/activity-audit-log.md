# Activity audit log

Integration projects, big or small, need administration, management and lifecycle capabilities from the integration platform. Your [team](/user-accounts-and-teams/team-collaboration.md) is likely to have multiple team members collaborating on the integration project. Your team may also include employees, short-term contractors and consultants. This makes it necessary for you to provide access to the Workato account to build, change and operate the recipes.

As team size and complexity grows around the project, it becomes increasingly important to have control and visibility on the activities within your Workato workspace.

## Overview

Activity audit provides a simple and powerful interface for Workato administrators to comprehensively track changes to  the account, connections, recipes, folders and packages. Throughout the lifecycle of your project, it gives you the visibility to quickly identify the changes and opportunity to analyze the impact of those changes.
* Comprehensive log of changes made to account, connection, folder, recipe and package
* Track nature of change (for example, recipe stopped), author, and timeline
* Quickly navigate to specific change activity using filters

Activity audit is available as part of an add-on. Reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.

The activity audit log is available in the `Dashboard` > `Audit` tab. With the activity audit log, you will be able to find out which user in the team stopped a business-critical recipe or disconnected a connection. You'll also be able to find out when the recipe was stopped or connection was disconnected.

Activity audit log is visible to owner of the account and the users with `Admin` role. Following documentation describes the different types of activity audit that is logged and viewable by the user.

## Activity audit data retention
The activity audit log data will be retained for one year from when it is generated. To get longer data retention period, you may reach out to Workato sales representative at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.

We strongly recommend that you use the activity log streaming to stream the audit log data to your choice of data storage like `Amazon S3` or data storage providers like `sumologic` using the standard REST API interface. You can find more information about audit log streaming [here](/job-history-replication.md).

## Activity audit logs in more detail

Imagine an unplanned stoppage of a business critical recipe syncing product SKU data between your ERP like NetSuite or SAP and e-commerce app; or an update to Salesforce connection settings rendering it inactive; or someone inadvertently deleting a employee onboarding recipe connecting to Workday, a connection, or a folder. As an administrator, would you like to know if user login has failed? And how many times? Below are some examples where you will find the audit of activities that provide just the answers to the scenarios outlined above.

#### Recipe stopped by user

#### Connection disconnected by user

![Connection disconnected](~@img/activity-audit/connection-disconnected-user.png "Connected disconnected by user")

#### Folder created

![Folder created](~@img/activity-audit/folder-created.png "Folder created")

#### Folder deleted

![Folder deleted](~@img/activity-audit/folder-deleted.png "Folder deleted")

#### User login

![User login](~@img/activity-audit/user-login.png "User login")

#### User login failed

![User login failed](~@img/activity-audit/user-login-failed.png "User login failed")

#### Invite team member

![Invite team member](~@img/activity-audit/team-invited-user.png "Invite team member")

#### Team member joined

![Team member joined](~@img/activity-audit/team-joined-user.png "Team member joined")

#### Using filters

Find information quickly and efficiently using time-based, user-based and Workato asset-based filters.

Filtering by time lets you see the activity audit for certain time period like last 7 days or 30 days and more.

![Time filter](~@img/activity-audit/filter-time.png "Filter by time period")

In this example, simply select the user to find all the activities by that user in the Workato workspace. If you have lot of team members collaborating on Workato, scrolling and selecting in the dropdown can become difficult, so we've made it easy to just type in the user name and find the user you want.

![User filter](~@img/activity-audit/filter-user.png "User filter")
![User search](~@img/activity-audit/filter-user-search.png "User search")

Similarly, find all the activities by any user on any Workato asset like recipes, folders, connections in the workspace using the asset filter. Similar to user search, you can simply type in the asset you want to filter and just select the asset from the result.

![Asset filter](~@img/activity-audit/filter-asset.png "Filter by asset type")
![Asset search](~@img/activity-audit/filter-asset-search.png "Search by asset type")
