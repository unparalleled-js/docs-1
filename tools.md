## Building recipes

Tools for building recipes are often associated with connectors, triggers and actions that users can select while building recipes. For example, setting up a lookup table in tools will allow the use of actions in the recipe which adds, removes or updates the lookup table using the connector in a recipe.

*Using the add row action in a recipe creates new rows in an existing lookup table*

These tools aid in making recipes more powerful with human approval capabilities as well as allow data to be reused across recipes in the same account.
